# jotbox

## Description
I have created an application called JotBox it is a straightforward application that lets you jot down and organize your notes. It provides an easy-to-use interface where you can create new notes, save them, and access them later. The app keeps things simple, focusing on helping you capture your thoughts without any fuss. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## User Story
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Installation
-In the terminal, run the following command to install project dependencies (make sure you are in your project directory): npm install
-Start the Server
-In the terminal, run the following command to start your server: node server.js
-This will start your Node.js server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specific port (usually 3000).
-Your Note Taker application should now be up and running locally. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.
