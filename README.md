# jotbox

## Description
I have created an application called JotBox it is a straightforward application that lets you jot down and organize your notes. It provides an easy-to-use interface where you can create new notes, save them, and access them later. The app keeps things simple, focusing on helping you capture your thoughts without any fuss. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## User Story
